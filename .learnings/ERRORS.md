# Errors

## 2026-07-02 — Knife14r exposed one-payload-per-tick uplink throttling

- Log bundle: `/tmp/mvpn_knife14r_usclient_suite_20260702_171341.tar.gz`
- Symptom: forward P1/P4/P8 stayed around low Mbit/s with long zero-bps gaps,
  and P2 timed out. `remote_write_timeout` was absent, so this was not the old
  QUIC write-deadline failure.
- Root cause in code: established uplink drained at most one smoltcp payload per
  dirty pass. Without continuous inbound wakeups, the 5ms timer became the
  effective throughput limiter.
- Correct behavior: drain a bounded batch per dirty pass, but reserve relay mpsc
  capacity before reading each payload so channel fullness still applies TCP
  backpressure.
- Future debugging rule: when measured throughput is suspiciously close to
  `MSS * timer frequency`, inspect event-loop batching before touching QUIC,
  congestion control, or VPS tuning.

## 2026-07-02 — Knife14r report could not prove the exact binary commit

- Log bundle: `/tmp/mvpn_knife14r_usclient_suite_20260702_171341.tar.gz`
- Symptom: the report showed `SUITE_TAG=knife14r`, but did not include
  `git rev-parse` output or binary checksum. The script also only built the
  release binary if it was missing.
- Correct behavior: test suites should record git commit, worktree status,
  binary path, and checksum; `BUILD_RELEASE=1` should rebuild before running.
- Future debugging rule: never analyze a VPS performance run as definitive until
  the report proves the binary came from the intended commit.

## 2026-07-02 — Knife14q showed fixed deferred-close grace still drops useful tail bytes

- Log bundle: `/tmp/mvpn_knife14q_usclient_suite_20260702_160853.tar.gz`
- Symptom: uplink `remote_write_timeout` was gone, but client diagnostics still
  showed `tcp-handle-close ... reason=dead_slot_reap state=Closing pending>0`
  with no corresponding send-slice or TUN flush failure.
- Rejected assumption: "relay close plus pending downlink only needs a fixed
  grace window from close time."
- Correct behavior: if pending downlink is still decreasing, refresh the reap
  deadline; reap only after no drain progress for the grace window.
- Future debugging rule: for pending-buffer lifecycle bugs, track progress
  counters and last-progress time, not just absolute age.

## 2026-07-02 — Knife14p VPS run exposed a wrong per-write timeout assumption

- Log bundle: `/tmp/mvpn_knife14p_usclient_suite_20260702_143215.tar.gz`
- Tested commit: `480c3e8`
- Symptom: throughput collapsed/timeouts while client logs contained
  `remote_write_timeout attempted_bytes=1160 timeout=5s`.
- Rejected assumption: a TUIC/QUIC stream write pending for 5s means the relay is
  broken.
- Correct behavior: pending writes are normal backpressure; keep the writer
  awaitable and let bounded relay-level idle/cleanup paths terminate true stalls.
- Future debugging rule: when a stage adds backpressure, verify which direction
  the evidence points to. `global_rx_pressure_events=0` meant knife14p's
  downlink mechanism was not firing; the next fix belonged in the uplink writer.
