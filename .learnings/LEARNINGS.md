## 2026-06-11 — Stage 13b: UDP over TUIC Packet rides the same authenticated QUIC connection

UDP relay now speaks **TUIC `Packet` (native QUIC datagram)** through the same sing-box exit as 13a's TCP:
Shenzhen client (tuic mode) → sing-box → `dig @1.1.1.1 example.com` returned Cloudflare's real A records,
`dig @1.1.1.1 facebook.com` a second flow, and `curl https://1.1.1.1/` still got `HTTP/2 301` (TCP
non-regression on the *same* connection). Lessons:

1. **A narrowed id space silently breaks an invariant inherited from a wider one.** `AssocTable` mirrors
   Stage-12 `FlowTable`'s "monotonic `next_id`, never reuse an id" scheme (so late datagrams can't cross
   into a new flow) — but in **u16**, `next_id` wraps after 65535 interns. The original copy assigned
   `next_id` unconditionally, so after a wrap it could `insert()` onto a *still-live* id (overwriting an
   active flow's mapping → downlink misroute) and orphan that flow's `tuple_to_id` entry (slow unbounded
   leak). `FlowTable` is safe only because u32 never wraps in practice. Fix: `alloc_id()` skips in-use ids;
   the live set (≤1024) ≪ 65536 so a free id always exists. Lesson: when you copy a table/allocator and
   shrink its key width, re-audit every "the space is so large this never happens" assumption.
2. **TUIC multiplexes TCP (bi-streams) and UDP (datagrams) over ONE authenticated connection.** sing-box
   validates auth per connection, so UDP datagrams must ride the *same* connection that sent Authenticate —
   you can't open a second anonymous QUIC connection for UDP. We funnel both `open_tcp` and `send_udp`/the
   datagram pump through a single `live_conn()` (reconnect serialized by one mutex), which is also why the
   TCP non-regression `curl` is a real test of co-existence, not a separate path.
3. **Downlink applies backpressure (`send().await`), uplink drops (`try`/count).** Dropping a DNS *response*
   on the downlink breaks `getaddrinfo`, so the datagram pump blocks rather than drops; the uplink keeps
   UDP semantics (drop + count on full / TooLarge / dead connection, self-heals on the next packet). Same
   asymmetry as Stage 12's `run_quic_pump`, reused deliberately.
4. **`@1.1.1.1` is the right UDP-relay probe precisely because it dodges the local fake-resolver.** The TUN
   only forges fake-IP answers for 198.18.0.1:53; every other `:53` goes to the relay (stage-12 D1 rule).
   So `dig @1.1.1.1` returning a *real* Cloudflare IP proves the query went out through TUIC Packet, not a
   local forgery — a self-forged answer would have returned a 198.18/15 address.

## 2026-06-10 — Stage 13a: our hand-written TUIC client interoperates with sing-box

The mini_vpn client now speaks the **TUIC v5 protocol** (ADR-0004) and was accepted by a real
**sing-box TUIC server** as the exit: Shenzhen client (tuic mode) → sing-box (US, UDP 8443) →
`curl https://1.1.1.1/` returned `HTTP/2 301` with Cloudflare's genuine TLS cert and `cf-ray …-SJC`
(US egress). Lessons:

1. **Interop is the proof of correctness.** A successful sing-box handshake validates the byte-exact
   parts that unit tests can't fully cover on their own: the Authenticate token derivation
   (`export_keying_material(label=UUID, context=password)`, 32 bytes) and the Connect/Address wire
   layout (TUIC ATYP 0x00 domain / 0x01 IPv4 / 0x02 IPv6 — different from our Stage-12 custom codes).
   We unit-tested the encoders against exact bytes, but "sing-box accepted it" is the real gate.
2. **Implementing a standard protocol > a bespoke one** for this goal: speaking TUIC means the exit is
   a mature, maintained sing-box (best experience, zero server code from us). The canonical TUIC repo is
   spec-only and the reference Rust crate is yanked, so we implemented the (stable) spec on our existing
   quinn — mature *design*, our *code*, full ecosystem interop.
3. **Dual-run keeps zero regression** while swapping the upstream: `MINI_VPN_UPSTREAM=legacy|tuic`
   (default legacy), an `Upstream` enum whose `open_tcp` returns a unified `RelayStream`, and the proven
   legacy path only *wrapped*, not modified.
4. **Concurrent sessions on one branch cause loss.** Another session committed to the same branch and
   clobbered a commit (recovered + pushed). Push after every commit and keep one writer per branch.

## 2026-06-08 — Stage 12 UDP-over-QUIC cross-machine acceptance; field-debugging lessons

UDP relay over a QUIC datagram data plane works end-to-end (Shenzhen client → US exit):
ATYP=1 (IP literal: `dig @1.1.1.1`, IP echo) and ATYP=3 (fake-IP→domain: `udp.zkwcloud.com`)
both relay; 1200-byte (QUIC-initial-sized) datagrams round-trip cold; **160 concurrent flows
= 160/160** with and without DNS. Several non-obvious lessons from the cross-machine bring-up:

1. **quinn defaults bite at three points; all needed tuning for a real long-lived data plane.**
   - `max_idle_timeout` defaults to 10s and `keep_alive_interval` to None → an idle QUIC
     connection drops every 10s and reconnects forever. Set keepalive **5s** (must be well under
     even a stale peer's 10s idle, since negotiated idle = min(both peers) — version skew between
     client and server made a 10s keepalive race the 10s boundary).
   - `initial_mtu` defaults to 1200 → `max_datagram_size` ~1162, too small for a 1200B inner
     payload (~1224 with our header), so a freshly-(re)connected data plane dropped large
     datagrams until PLPMTUD warmed. Set `initial_mtu`/`min_mtu` = **1280** (IPv6 minimum) so it
     fits cold. Note quinn's "MTU" is the UDP payload size, not the IP packet — 1280 is safe on
     real IPv4/1500 paths.
   - Both keepalive and MTU live in the **shared** transport config → BOTH ends must be rebuilt;
     a stale server silently dropped the 1200B *downlink* (1204B) as oversized. Always confirm
     `git log -1` matches on every box before trusting a cross-machine result.

2. **Per-packet `println!` on a single-threaded TUN loop is catastrophic under concurrency.**
   The device dumped the full packet bytes every recv and the whole tx_queue every transmit;
   under an 8-way burst this starved the loop, overflowed the utun buffer, and dropped UDP
   (concurrent 1/160). Removing per-packet/byte-dump logging (keep per-flow + drop/error logs)
   took it to 50/160. Logging on the data-plane hot path must be per-flow, not per-packet.

3. **Localize before fixing — a passing loopback test + a field-isolating test pin the layer.**
   A loopback integration test (one QUIC connection, 100 concurrent flows, ≥90/100) proved the
   relay/server were fine, pointing at the client TUN loop. Then an IP-literal-vs-domain field
   test split DNS contention from relay throughput.

4. **The test harness was the final bottleneck.** `ncat -k -u -e /bin/cat` is connection-oriented
   / forks per peer; our server uses one egress socket per flow, so the echo saw 160 distinct
   peers and choked (15/160). A single-socket Python echo (`recvfrom`/`sendto` loop) → 160/160.
   When a relay test underperforms, suspect the echo endpoint before the relay.

## 2026-06-02 — fake-IP end-to-end reached a GFW-blocked domain; two TUN-UDP source-address gotchas

Stage 11 fake-IP worked end-to-end: Shenzhen `curl https://www.facebook.com/` →
local fake-IP → tunnel → US exit resolves the domain → real Meta server (HTTP/2 200,
genuine `*.facebook.com` cert). First time the project bypassed local DNS poisoning.

Two non-obvious bugs, both about the **source address of replies from an AnyIP TUN**:
1. The fake DNS resolver listens on 198.18.0.1:53 via AnyIP, but a reply must carry
   src=198.18.0.1. Two things were required and BOTH were needed:
   (a) add 198.18.0.1 to the iface ip_addrs (else smoltcp can't egress that src), and
   (b) bind the UDP socket to the concrete 198.18.0.1 (NOT addr:None) — with None,
   smoltcp picks the reply source by subnet match (dst 10.0.0.1 → src 10.0.0.2), the
   OS resolver drops replies whose source != the queried server, and the symptom is
   `curl: Could not resolve host` while our log clearly shows the query arriving.
   The tx queue staying EMPTY (`发货单：[]`) was the tell that the reply never egressed.

Two follow-ups (logged in TODO):
- First TCP SYN to a freshly-allocated fake-IP can hit `connection refused` (curl does
  NOT retry on refused, unlike on timeout) — likely a race between the SYN inspector
  building the listener and the SYN being processed.
- Large HTTP/2 / multiplexed streams can fail mid-transfer with `bad decrypt` — relay
  byte-stream corruption/reordering under load; mechanism is correct (first request got
  a full 200) but high-throughput stability needs investigation.

## 2026-06-01 — Full jitter is observable and correct in the reconnect logs

Stage 10 cross-machine test (kill/restart US server) showed reconnect delays of
409/440/1554/354/5966ms — non-monotonic. That non-monotonicity is the proof that
full jitter is working: plain exponential backoff would be strictly increasing
(500/1000/2000...). The randomness is what spreads 5000 clients' reconnect
moments and prevents a thundering herd. When validating backoff, check that the
delays are NOT monotonic — a monotonic sequence means jitter is broken.

Also confirmed: infinite retry (4 failures then success) + reset-on-success
(second disconnect cycle restarts the attempt counter) + epoch increments per
reconnect (1→2→3). No panic when reconnecting while idle (0 in-flight to reset).

## 2026-06-01 — Byte-level transparent TCP relay preserves end-to-end TLS

Stage 9 cross-machine test against `https://1.1.1.1/` produced a full TLS 1.3
handshake where curl saw Cloudflare's real leaf certificate (`CN=cloudflare-dns.com`,
SSL.com intermediate) — not our dev cert. Confirms that the smoltcp + yamux + TLS
pipeline only carries opaque bytes; the inner TLS session is established between
the original client (curl) and the real target (Cloudflare), with our tunnel
acting as a pure pipe. HTTP/2 multiplexing also works end-to-end. This is the
right property for a VPN: the tunnel must NOT terminate the user's TLS or it
would break SNI / cert pinning / E2E privacy.

## 2026-05-27 — Verify worktree baseline before any design/implementation

The session worktree `claude/frosty-gates-10390f` was 39 commits behind `main`
(client_tun.rs was 133 lines vs main's 867). All early code reading was against
`main`'s files via absolute paths, so the design discussion nearly proceeded on a
stale base. Fixed with `git merge --ff-only main` (worktree HEAD was an ancestor of
main, 0 unique commits, no loss).

- Before designing/implementing in a worktree, check `git -C <worktree> log` and
  `git rev-list --count HEAD..main`. Don't assume the worktree == latest.

## 2026-05-27 — Run git in the worktree, not the main checkout

`cd /…/mini_vpn && git status` runs in the MAIN repo; the session's working tree is
the worktree under `.claude/worktrees/…`. New files written to the worktree won't show
in a `git status` run from main. Use `git -C <worktree-path>` or stay in the default
cwd (the worktree) — avoid `cd`-ing to the main checkout for git ops.

## 2026-05-29 — Always check the binary's startup banner before debugging behavior

A cross-machine test failed mysteriously: many `📡 收到` SYN logs, zero
`🎯 extracted target`, server kept reporting yamux disconnects. Root cause was
NOT code or topology — it was a stale binary. Stage 8 changes lived only on the
worktree branch, but the user was running `./target/debug/mini_vpn` built from
the main checkout (still at pre-Stage 8). The diagnostic tell was the startup
banner: it contained `target=httpbin.org:80` (a field Task 3 had removed),
proving the running binary predated Task 3.

- After ANY code change, first check the startup banner / version line matches
  the expected build. Don't debug behavior against a binary you didn't just compile.
- When work lives on a feature branch / worktree, prefer running the binary from
  that worktree's `target/debug/` until the branch is merged, or merge first.

## 2026-05-27 — Same-machine upstream + a global TUN host route = egress loop

Stage 8 round-trip test failed with the upstream `server` on localhost: the
`route add -host <target> -interface <our-utun>` is machine-global, so the
server's own `connect(<target>)` egress is ALSO diverted into our TUN instead of
reaching the real internet -> `Connection refused` / loop. Target extraction
itself worked (client logged `🎯 extracted target 1.1.1.1:80`, server logged the
correct target); only the outbound hop broke.

- The full byte round-trip can only be validated with the upstream on a
  DIFFERENT host (the real VPN topology — e.g. the US server). On a single
  machine the route inevitably captures the server's egress to the target.
- Always use an IP literal as the test target on dev machines: a co-resident
  fake-ip TUN proxy (Clash/Mihomo) hijacks DNS to 198.18.0.0/15.

Note: `67c466b add` committed the worktree directory itself as a gitlink
(mode 160000 `.claude/worktrees/frosty-gates-10390f`). Recursive/self-referential;
worth cleaning up separately.
